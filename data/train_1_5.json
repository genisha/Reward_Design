This includes moving the drone away from any objects in its path (front) and staying within the boundaries of the field of view.\n2. **Path Following**: If the drone encounters an obstacle, it will lose points or receive penalties for following the incorrect path.\n3. **Object Detection**: If the drone detects an object",
